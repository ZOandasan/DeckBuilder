# UniversalDeckBuilder
The Universal Deck Builder is a web based application designed for users to create decks for trading card games. This application does not facilitate a playspace for users to play, but instead provides the resources to play either in person or via a virtual tabletop. 
Users can select a card game to build a deck in, then be provided a list containing all cards. Users can then add cards to their deck using this list. 
When the user is satisfied with their deck, they can export it into a playable format.
